      <b>Canada's Vanessa "Niffller" Kade has forever etched her name in online poker history after defeating "Talibenes" in heads-up play to win the <a href="#" target="_blank" style="color: #E33355;">Sunday Million</a> 15th Anniversary at PokerStars. Both the top two players snagged more than a million with Kade banking $1,514,920 and "Talibenes" taking home $1,035,358. // Spoiler</b>

      It's only the third time in 11 years — counting the 2018 redux — that the anniversary edition ended with an outright winner rather than a deal, and Kade's prize stands as the biggest ever awarded in the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-known streamer, Kade has made waves recently in a well-publicized clash with Dan Bilzerian, and she subsequently secured an equally high-profile sponsorship deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the turmoil in recent months ultimately led to the biggest win of her life, and she fired off a euphoric tweet to her many followers when the tournament ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to Kade and many other poker players that went deep in the Sunday Million 15th Anniversary, PokerStars has something to be proud of as well. The nearly 70,000 entrants — 69,876 was the final count — generated $13,975,200 for the second-largest prize pool in Sunday Million Anniversary event history. Only last year's lockdown-boosted event was bigger.

      The final day began with just 65 hopefuls remaining, each guaranteed a payout of at least $10,757 with their eyes on much more. Romania's "Transylvanian" began the day with the chip lead with Kade near the top of the pack in 13th place.

      So, what's wrong with those thoughts? The problem is we're trying to put our opponent on a single hand. Yes, in the end, he is holding one specific hand. But right now we just don't know what hand he has. 
    </p>

      Unless he shows us his cards we can't be certain about it. So why would we act like we have some magical ability to read his hand? We simply can't and we shouldn't!

      So, what's wrong with those thoughts? The problem is we're trying to put our opponent on a single hand. Yes, in the end, he is holding one specific hand. But right now we just don't know what hand he has.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Let's go through the previous example hand and apply some logic to what our opponent might be holding. Before his first action we don't know anything about his hand so each possible holding is equally likely. There are 1,326 possible starting hands in Texas Hold'em. But since we're holding two cards ourselves (two 10s) there are only 1,225 combinations left for our opponent. Before his first action we know he's equally likely to have any of those holdings. Those are a quite a lot of combinations to consider, but fortunately we can remove lots of them (almost all them actually) after our opponent’s first action.
    </p>
    <p>
      We almost never have enough information to exactly know our opponent’s hole cards and there’s a reasonable chance we’re dead wrong with our read. We’d look rather foolish (and possibly lose a good chunk of money) if we pinpointed his holding to be a flush draw when in fact our opponent is dominating us with a set.
    </p>
    <p>
      hand? It's quite simple: We just put him on all possible hands at once. This might sound a bit hare-brained but in fact it's much more sound and reliable than putting him on just one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now instead of trying to decide which of those possible holdings our opponent has in this situation, and playing according to this “read,” we just put him on all those possibilities at once and try to find a play that works best against most of those holdings.

    <h3>Final Table Payouts - H3</h3>
    <p>
      Kade began to build momentum and was in second place after her ace-queen held against the ace-seven suited of "malinga." Still, it was a distant second until she doubled through Ladniak when kings held against ace-ten to give her a comparable stack four-handed.

      Heads-up play lasted just two hands with Kade holding a monster chip advantage against Ladniak, who laddered with 15 big blinds when PanchoVetin had him out-chipped more than 2-to-1. She jammed with eights and then won one last flip against king-nine to be crowned the champion.
